🔐 Secure Your Own Wi-Fi Network – Proof of Concept

A real-life inspired project demonstrating how to detect unauthorized devices on your Wi-Fi network, understand how attacks work, and implement practical steps to secure your home Wi-Fi.
📖 Story Behind the Project

During the COVID-19 shift to remote work, I discovered multiple unknown devices on my home Wi-Fi. This surprising experience led me to explore network security, identify vulnerabilities, and eventually build this project to raise awareness and help others secure their networks too.
🛠️ Tools & Commands Used
📡 Network Scanning

    arp-scan -l – Discover devices on your local network

    Router admin panel – Identify & block unknown devices

🔍 Wi-Fi Attack Simulation (POC)

    Wi-Fi adapter in monitor mode

    Tools: iwconfig, airmon-ng, airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, aircrack-ng

    Capturing 4-way handshake and attempting password cracking via dictionary attack

🕵️ Network Traffic Monitoring

    Tools: Nmap, Wireshark

    Observing open ports, capturing data packets, and understanding risks like credential theft

🛡️ How to Protect Your Wi-Fi Network
Key Recommendations:

    Change default router credentials

    Use WPA3 or WPA2 (AES) encryption

    Disable WPS

    Update router firmware regularly

    Set up a guest network

    Block unknown devices

    Separate IoT devices from personal ones

    Monitor your network monthly

    Turn off remote management

    Use a strong Wi-Fi password

💡 Lessons Learned

    Realized how easy it is for others to connect to insecure networks

    Learned practical tools for detection and defense

    Gained confidence in basic network security practices
